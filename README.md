Chess_Python
============

Python course project - Chess

The idea - to make the popular game of Chess (by the rules in wikipedia -
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)

It will be played by two people on the same computer.
The game will have both console and graphic interface.

There are no additional features planned for now.
However there are few ideas that might come to life if everything goes well:

    1) Create players with passwords so that no other people can play with the
    same username on the same computer.

    2) Ranklist for players (by number of victories)

    3) Single player

    4) Different difficulties for single player
