CHESS
=====

The idea
--------

To make the popular game of Chess (by the rules in wikipedia -
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)

It will be played by two people on the same computer.
The game will have both console and graphic interface.

There are no additional features planned for now.
However there are few ideas that might come to life if everything goes well:

    1) Create players with passwords so that no other people can play with the
    same username on the same computer.

    2) Ranklist for players (by number of victories)

    3) Single player

    4) Different difficulties for single player


Goals for the second milestone
------------------------------

    1) To have working move validations for every figure.

    2) To have thorough tests.

    3) To have at least started working on the console UI.


Current status
--------------

	Working console UI from multiplayer.py.

	Working graphic UI from gui.py.
		In gui when pawn is on the end and has to be promoted, the player has to write the new figure's name in the console.

	Due to the number of exams I have in the days until the project deadline, no additional features will be added.
